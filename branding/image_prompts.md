## ML Stack Logo

```
A professional, modern logo for "Stan's ML Stack" featuring AMD GPU technology. The logo should incorporate the AMD red color (#ED1C24) and show a stylized stack of GPUs with neural network connections. The design should be clean, minimalist, and suitable for both light and dark backgrounds. Include subtle references to machine learning and GPU computing.
```

## GitHub Repository Banner

```
A wide banner image (1280x640px) for a GitHub repository called "Stan's ML Stack". The banner should feature AMD Radeon GPUs (specifically the RX 7900 XTX and RX 7800 XT) with glowing red accents. The background should be dark with code snippets and neural network visualizations. Include the text "Stan's ML Stack" in a modern tech font. The overall style should be professional and high-tech, suitable for a machine learning repository focused on AMD GPU optimization.
```

## Patreon Tier Images

### Coffee Supporter Tier

```
A professional illustration for a Patreon tier called "Coffee Supporter" ($5/month) for an AMD GPU machine learning project. The image should feature a stylized coffee cup with steam that forms into neural network patterns. Use a teal color scheme (#6ECACF) with subtle AMD red accents. The design should be clean, modern, and appealing to tech enthusiasts.
```

### Code Enthusiast Tier

```
A professional illustration for a Patreon tier called "Code Enthusiast" ($10/month) for an AMD GPU machine learning project. The image should feature stylized code snippets and GPU architecture elements. Use a purple color scheme (#9C89B8) with subtle AMD red accents. The design should convey the idea of diving deeper into machine learning code and GPU optimization.
```

### ML Stack Pro Tier

```
A professional illustration for a Patreon tier called "ML Stack Pro" ($25/month) for an AMD GPU machine learning project. The image should feature a premium, high-end visualization of AMD Radeon GPU hardware with glowing elements and advanced neural network structures. Use a gold color scheme (#F0A202) with AMD red accents. The design should convey expertise, optimization, and professional-level machine learning development.
```

## Social Media Profile Image

```
A professional profile picture for a machine learning developer specializing in AMD GPU optimization. The image should be a stylized avatar that incorporates elements of AMD GPU technology and neural networks. Use the AMD red color (#ED1C24) as an accent color with a dark background. The design should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes while conveying expertise in GPU-accelerated machine learning.
```

## Documentation Header Image

```
A wide header image (1200x300px) for documentation pages of "Stan's ML Stack". The image should visualize the architecture of a machine learning stack optimized for AMD GPUs. Include representations of ROCm, PyTorch, ONNX, MIGraphX, and Megatron-LM in a flowing, connected design. Use a color scheme that incorporates AMD red (#ED1C24) with complementary blues and purples. The style should be technical yet approachable, with subtle grid patterns and code elements in the background.
```

## Benchmark Results Visualization

```
A professional data visualization image for machine learning benchmarks comparing performance between AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7800 XT GPUs. The image should feature stylized bar charts or line graphs showing performance metrics with the 7900 XTX outperforming the 7800 XT. Use AMD red (#ED1C24) for the 7900 XTX and a complementary color for the 7800 XT. Include subtle neural network patterns in the background. The visualization should be clean, modern, and data-focused while maintaining visual appeal.
```

## Installation Guide Icon

```
A simple, professional icon for an installation guide section of "Stan's ML Stack" documentation. The icon should represent the installation of machine learning software on AMD GPUs. Incorporate elements like a download symbol, AMD GPU, and a simplified ROCm logo. Use AMD red (#ED1C24) as the primary color with a clean, minimalist design that works well at small sizes.
```

## Troubleshooting Guide Icon

```
A simple, professional icon for a troubleshooting guide section of "Stan's ML Stack" documentation. The icon should represent fixing issues with machine learning software on AMD GPUs. Incorporate elements like a wrench or gear with a stylized GPU and warning symbol. Use AMD red (#ED1C24) as an accent color with a clean, minimalist design that works well at small sizes.
```

## Performance Optimization Icon

```
A simple, professional icon for a performance optimization section of "Stan's ML Stack" documentation. The icon should represent improving machine learning performance on AMD GPUs. Incorporate elements like a speedometer, GPU, and upward trending graph. Use AMD red (#ED1C24) as an accent color with a clean, minimalist design that works well at small sizes.
